### Hi there 👋

I'm a Customer Success Technical Architect at Confluent, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka.

🗣️ I created two years ago now an [open source project](https://github.com/LGouellec/kafka-streams-dotnet) which names Streamiz as a .NET Stream Processing Library for Apache Kafka 🚀 

The aim of this project is to deliver a .NET library to allow the stream processing mindset with Apache Kafka in the .NET world.
